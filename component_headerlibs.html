<!--This file is a small HTML template fragment that loads two important JavaScript libraries for the project.

    PixiJS (pixi.min.js): A fast 2D rendering engine, often used for interactive graphics and games.
    Bootbox (bootbox.js): A library for creating programmatic dialog boxes or pupups in the browser.

This file is included in other HTML templates using {% include "component_headerlibs.html" %} or similar.
It ensures that the required JavaScript libraries are available for any page that needs them, such as FlowerField.html .-->
